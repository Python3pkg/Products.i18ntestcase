      comments (# Original: "").

I18NTestCase 0.2 - released September 3, 2005

    - Got rid of a bunch of external binary dependencies by replacing the 
      testNoDuplicateMsgId() test by the Python-only version taken from CPS.
      [hannosch]

    - Reordered the "if __name__ == '__main__':" magic calls in a way that
      calling the test_i18n.py script directly also works.
